# About:
This repository is for the project titled a Health and Wellness Landing Page.

The name of the website is Health and Wellness.


# Notes:
Collaborators are advised to read this before adding features in order to first make the initial website.

# In Scope (What the project will include):
1. Clear and Compelling Headline: The page will have compelling headline to communicate the main benefit of the landing page.

2. Concise Value Proposition: The page will briefly explain what it offers and why it's valuable.

3. High-Quality Visuals: The page will use professional images or videos that resonate with the target audience and convey health and well-being. 

4. Call to Action (CTA): The page will have a prominent button or link that encourages visitors to take the next step, the next step being: “Get Started”, “Sign Up Free” and “Learn More”. This will be the primary focus.
 
5. Brief Overview of Services/Products: The page will highlight the key features and benefits of what's being offered.
 
6. Mobile Responsiveness: The landing page will look and function perfectly on all devices that is, desktops, tablets and smartphones.
 
7. Basic Contact Information: The page will include a way for visitors to get in touch that is, email address, contact numbers and social media accounts.


#  Out of Scope (What the project will not include):
1. Blog Integration: While valuable for content marketing, a blog will not be included in the page for the initial launch.

2. E-commerce Functionality: The page will focus on lead generation rather than direct sales. E-commerce can be added later. 

3. User Accounts and Login: Complex user management systems will not be available in the page.

4. Advanced Personalization: While personalization is great, it's often too complex for a Minimum Viable Product. The page will start with a general offering and personalize later based on user data.

5. Live Chat Support: The page will not include a live chat support.
A/B Testing (Initially): While A/B testing is important, the page will not include it.
 
6. Multiple Language Support: The page will start with one language and expand later. The language will be English.

7. Complex Integrations: The page will not integrate many third-party services in the initial phase. It will only focus on the essentials.

8. Detailed Testimonials/Case Studies: The page will gather these after it has had some initial users/customers.
